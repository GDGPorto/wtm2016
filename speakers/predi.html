<h2>Implementing Predictive Maintenance with the InValue platform</h2>
<p>This talk will present the INVALUE project, whose purpose is the development of a platform that will facilitate the implementation of predictive maintenance in the manufacturing industry.</p>
    <p>This project is the joint effort of four Portuguese companies and a R&D centre. Given the complexity of the problem, the development of the platform requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves concepts and technologies such as sensor technology, big data, intelligent data analysis and human-machine interfaces, among others.</p>
