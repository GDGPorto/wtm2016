<h2>Smart Cloud of Things (SCoT) an IoT/M2M platform</h2>
<p>IT Aveiro have been heavily invested in IoT and M2M technology. Not only in the communication layer but also in analytic potential of these technologies (from collecting data, processing information and visualization). Although many environments are powered by smart solutions, end users do not have a simple way to gather their collective knowledge, learn patterns and program's device's behavior. SCoT (Smart Cloud of Things) is the answer develop by IT Aveiro. The architecture builds upon ETSI standards, combined with a rich service execution environment, providing facilitated orchestration of services and devices, as well as integrated portals for end users access. It was successfully deployed in several scenarios: green house monitoring, smart farming and porthole detection.</p>
