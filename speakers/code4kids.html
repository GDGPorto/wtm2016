<h2>Workshop: Programação para crianças</h2>
<p>Technology is a fundamental part of today’s world. Understanding it is a basic knowledge that every child should have access to. It’s vital that students in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we are going to use Code.org a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities.</p>

<p>We are going to do an Hour of Code where the basic concepts of Computer Science with drag and drop programming will be addressed. This is a game-like, self-directed tutorial starring video lectures by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies. Learn repeat-loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.</p>
