<h2>Isabel Portugal</h2>
<p>I am passionate about information and data analysis and eager to learn as much as I can in order to help companies pursue data-driven approaches. After taken a Bachelors in Economics I've decided to pursue a post-graduation in Business Intelligence and Analytics at Porto Business School in order to study different ways of how to extract, treat, analyse and visualize information.</p>
    <p>For the last two years I've been also helping several companies extract value from their data and I've been involved in tech communities like Geek Girls Portugal, GDG Porto and Data Science Portugal.</p>
